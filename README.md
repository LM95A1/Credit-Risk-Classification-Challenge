# Credit Risk Analysis: Evaluating Loan Default Risk
*Supervised Machine Learning Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 20*

## Background
This assignment utilizes Python and machine learning algorithms to predict the credit risk of loans. Leveraging Logistic Regression, we strive to evaluate the likelihood of loans defaulting or staying healthy based on a myriad of financial factors. Our model is designed to be a reliable tool for financial institutions to gauge credit risk.

## Dependencies
To execute the code, ensure you've installed the following Python libraries:

- *Pandas* for data manipulation
- *Scikit-Learn* for machine learning and data preprocessing
- *TensorFlow* for neural network modeling

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Assignment Files
The repository holds these vital files:

- `lending_data.csv`: Stores the raw loan data.
- `credit_risk_classification.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing Python code and in-depth analysis.
- `classification_report.md`: A markdown file containing the classification report of the model's performance and findings.

Using machine learning, specifically Logistic Regression, the assignment aims to provide substantial insights into the credit risk tied to loans. The analysis should help financial institutions make more well-informed lending decisions.

## Analysis
The analysis unfolds in these core steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
3. Creating a Logistic Regression Model
4. Evaluating the Model's Performance

*Each step is elaborated in the Jupyter Notebook. All code was developed in Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.11.*
